## Usage

These patterns help Claude:
1. Recommend consistent approaches to common problems
2. Suggest code that aligns with the established patterns in the codebase
3. Identify code that deviates from established patterns
4. Provide context-aware refactoring suggestions

## Maintenance

When identifying new effective patterns or refining existing ones:
1. Document the pattern with clear examples
2. Explain the context where the pattern should be applied
3. Describe alternatives and when they might be appropriate
4. Update existing pattern files when better approaches are identified

Keeping these pattern documents updated ensures that Claude can provide recommendations that align with the evolving best practices of the codebase.
