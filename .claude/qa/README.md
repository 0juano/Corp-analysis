# QA Directory

This directory implements a queries-and-answers database that documents previously solved problems, their context, and the reasoning used to solve them. It serves as a knowledge base that Claude can reference when encountering similar issues in the future.

## Structure

### components/
This subdirectory contains component-specific Q&A entries, organized by component name:
- `App/`: Q&A entries for the App component
- Other component-specific directories as they are added

### qa_template.json
A template for logging Q&A entries with the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-qa-id",
  "timestamp": "ISO date string",
  "component": "ComponentName",
  "category": "Category (e.g., Bug, Feature, Performance)",
  "query": {
    "original_question": "The original question or problem statement",
    "clarifications": [
      "Any clarifying questions and answers"
    ],
    "context": {

## Usage

This Q&A database helps Claude:
1. Recognize similar problems to ones previously solved
2. Apply proven solution strategies
3. Understand the reasoning behind solutions
4. Provide consistent answers to recurring questions

## Maintenance

After solving significant problems or answering important questions:
1. Create a new Q&A entry using the template
2. Place it in the appropriate component directory
3. Ensure all fields are filled with detailed information
4. Link related Q&A entries where applicable
5. Use descriptive tags for better searchability

Over time, this database will become an invaluable resource for maintaining knowledge about the codebase and ensuring consistent problem-solving approaches.
